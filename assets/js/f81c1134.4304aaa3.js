Here are three things that\\r\\nwould have saved me time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n## 1. Build things before you feel ready\\r\\n\\r\\nTutorials feel productive, but you only really learn when you get stuck on\\r\\nyour own project. My first MERN app was messy \u2014 and that\'s exactly why it\\r\\ntaught me more than any course.\\r\\n\\r\\n## 2. Learn debugging, not just coding\\r\\n\\r\\nKnowing how to read stack traces, use breakpoints, and isolate problems is\\r\\nmore valuable than memorizing syntax. This skill compounds over time.\\r\\n\\r\\n## 3. Pick a stack and go deep\\r\\n\\r\\nI spent months jumping between frameworks. Progress came when I committed to\\r\\nthe MERN/PERN stacks and built real projects with them.
