I've been meaning to build a personal site for a while. A place to share what
I learn, document solutions I keep coming back to, and keep track of projects
I'm working on.


As a backend developer, most of my work lives in terminals, APIs, and databases
— not exactly the most visual stuff. But writing about it forces me to
understand things better, and if someone else finds it useful, even better.

This site is built with Docusaurus and hosted on GitHub Pages. I plan to use
the blog for longer posts and reflections, the Notes section for quick
references, and Gists for reusable code snippets.

If you want to connect, find me on
[GitHub](https://github.com/josearcani) or
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josearcani/).
