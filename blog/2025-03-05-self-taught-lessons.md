I came from an electronics engineering background and taught myself web
development through books, FreeCodeCamp, and Udemy. Here are three things that
would have saved me time.


## 1. Build things before you feel ready

Tutorials feel productive, but you only really learn when you get stuck on
your own project. My first MERN app was messy — and that's exactly why it
taught me more than any course.

## 2. Learn debugging, not just coding

Knowing how to read stack traces, use breakpoints, and isolate problems is
more valuable than memorizing syntax. This skill compounds over time.

## 3. Pick a stack and go deep

I spent months jumping between frameworks. Progress came when I committed to
the MERN/PERN stacks and built real projects with them. Breadth comes later.
