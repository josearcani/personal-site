# Gists

Short, reusable snippets of code and configuration that come in handy across projects. Think of this section as a personal reference — the kind of things developers typically save as GitHub Gists:

- Code snippets and utility functions
- Shell commands and one-liners
- Configuration templates (Docker, CI/CD, linters)
- SQL queries and database scripts
- API request examples
- Environment setup notes
- Mock data for testing and demos
